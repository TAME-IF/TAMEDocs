	<strong>Modal</strong> actions are actions that require a <em>mode</em>, or rather, take specific parameters (called "modes") that are not related to
	anything in the world. Things like:
</p>
<pre>
	go west
	look up
	walk east
</pre>
<p>
	...where <em>west</em>, <em>up</em>, and <em>east</em> do not refer to objects in the world, but are specific enough for TAME to check the validity of.
