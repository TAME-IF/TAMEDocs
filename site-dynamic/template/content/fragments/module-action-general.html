	<strong>General</strong> actions are actions that do not require any additional references to objects or other things in the world
	in order to do things. General actions are things like:
</p>
<pre>
	look around
	yell
	inventory
</pre>
<p>
	...stuff that can just be done to nothing in particular ("yell" is <em>general</em>. "yell at bob" is <em>transitive</em>).
