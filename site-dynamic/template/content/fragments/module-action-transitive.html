	<strong>Transitive</strong> actions are actions that require an object in order to perform it. The object just needs to be <em>accessible</em>
	to the current player (or in the <em>world</em> if no player).

<pre>
	pick up key
	look at lamp
	open door
</pre>
<p>
	...where <em>key</em>, <em>lamp</em>, and <em>door</em> are names of objects in the module.
