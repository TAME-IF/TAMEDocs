<p>
	After the context initialization, TAME does <em>not</em> execute the 
	<a href="language-block-after-successful-command.html">afterSuccessfulCommand()</a> block, 
	<a href="language-block-after-failed-command.html">afterFailedCommand()</a> block, nor the
	<a href="language-block-after-every-command.html">afterEveryCommand()</a> block. Initialization does not
	count as a "command" executed.
