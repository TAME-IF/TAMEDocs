		Object names, when added to (but not removed from) objects, are sanitized, such that multi-word names only contain one space to
		separate words. For example, <kbd>red&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;paint</kbd> turns into <kbd>red paint</kbd>.
		Functions that check for matching names do not sanitize the name that is looked for.
