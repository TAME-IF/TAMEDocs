		Returns the result of testing if a value is comparatively greater than or equal to the other. Type does not make a difference -
		the values are compared as though they are strings if either is a string, otherwise they are compared by their double-equivalent type.
		Comparing to <kbd>NaN</kbd> is always <kbd>false</kbd>. <strong>Lists</strong> cannot be compared.
		Resultant value type is always <strong>boolean</strong>.
