		TAME itself is essentially a logic kernel that accepts input (usually submitted using a <em>shell</em>), processes it, 
		changes a module context's state, and returns a result. <strong>Requests</strong> are created and sent to the 
		context, and a <strong>Response</strong> is generated that contains data to relate to the user. This data is a list 
		of items called <strong>Cues</strong>.

<div class="w3-container">
	<p>
		Input into TAME is usually a user-typed string like:
	</p>
<pre>
	pick up lamp
	look at dog
	scream
</pre>
	<p>
		TAME takes this input and wraps it in a <strong>Request</strong> object. The <strong>Interpreter</strong> figures out the <em>Action</em> and the <em>Object</em>s involved
		and then queues that action for processing, then after all actions are processed, a <strong>Response</strong> is sent back about what happened in TAME as a result.
		Usually, this Response contains <strong>Cues</strong> that the shell needs to process.

<div id="response" class="w3-panel w3-light-gray w3-card-2">
	<h2><a href="#response"><i class="link-stub fa fa-link"></i></a> 2.2 Response and Cues <a class="w3-right" href="#top"><i class="link-stub fa fa-arrow-up"></i></a></h2>
</div>
<div class="w3-container">
	<p>
		Every TAME request gets a <strong>Response</strong>. The Response contains things like:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>How long it took to interpret the input.</li>
		<li>How long it took to process the request.</li>
		<li>How many commands called to complete the full request.</li>
		<li>The list of Cues returned.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		After the response is received, the Shell has to do something wih it. Each of the <strong>Cues</strong> in the Response 
		is something for the Shell to do, <em>in the order that they are read from the list</em>, before it can send input again. 
		Not every TAME Shell can or should handle these Cues, but there are a few types of Cues that ALL Shells need to
		handle.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can see these Cues when you run modules in this documentation in <em>DEBUG</em> mode.
	</p>
	<p>
		The fact that not every Shell can handle every Cue is the thing that gives TAME flexibility in authoring - some Cues can
		be graphical, some can change a screen layout, and some could refer to music or sound effects, but this is only relevant
		to special shells. If written properly, the same TAME module can be executed in both a rich multimedia environment, as well
		as a purely textual environment, like a command terminal or even across an IRC server!

		For the most part, the most common TAME setup is this one - a user that interacts with a shell that changes a context, and 
		the separation between shell, context, and module doesn't exist (for instance, most all-in-one adventures or games).
	</p>
	<img class="w3-image tame-diagram" src="images/tame-diagram-1.svg" />
	<p>
		But to be honest, they do not have to be together conceptually - the shell can be a dumb terminal that relies on the context for parsing and execution, like
		a website that holds a context and the engine in memory, and can change its frontend appearance at will, or start new games.
	</p>
	<img class="w3-image tame-diagram" src="images/tame-diagram-2.svg" />
	<p>
		In fact, in some multi-user versions, you can have a system built to handle input from many users with 
		many separate contexts, all built from the same module, like a old-school UNIX-style terminal system or an interactive IRC bot!
	</p>
	<img class="w3-image tame-diagram" src="images/tame-diagram-3.svg" />
	<p>
		It is this separation that gives TAME additional flexibility, be it for authoring, rendering, or running on multiple platforms that have a TAME
		implementation. But regardless of the implementation, TAME still follows the same Request-Response model.
