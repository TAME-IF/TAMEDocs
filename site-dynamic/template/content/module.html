<div class="w3-container" style="margin-top: 2em;">
	<p>
		A <strong>module</strong> in TAME is comprised of <em>elements</em>. Each element has a conceptual purpose. How
		these elements are defined determine how they are interacted with and what happens when users interact with it.
	</p>
	<p>
		Modules hold the entirety of a game's world: its <strong>Objects</strong>, 
		<strong>Rooms</strong>, <strong>Player</strong> Viewpoints, abstract <strong>Containers</strong>,
		and the <strong>World</strong> itself. All of these elements hold a context and a set of variable values.
	</p>
	<p>
		Modules also hold <strong>Actions</strong>, which determine the means that a user interacts with objects
		and the world.
	</p>
</div>

<div id="world" class="w3-panel w3-light-gray w3-card-2">
	<h2><a href="#world"><i class="link-stub fa fa-link"></i></a> 2.1 World <a class="w3-right" href="#top"><i class="link-stub fa fa-arrow-up"></i></a></h2>
</div>
<div class="w3-container">
	<p>
		Every module contains one <strong>world</strong>. The world is the main abstraction of the concept of <em>everything</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The world can also hold <strong>objects</strong> that are <em>accessible</em> to all players (even if no player is set). 
		While nothing is specifically connected to it, it is a primary context that you can count on existing, and contains entry 
		points that are executed every request, or after the module initializes. All actions and failure to execute 
		actions fall through to this for handling. 
	</p>
</div>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<div id="players" class="w3-panel w3-light-gray w3-card-2">
	<h2><a href="#players"><i class="link-stub fa fa-link"></i></a> 2.2 Players <a class="w3-right" href="#top"><i class="link-stub fa fa-arrow-up"></i></a></h2>
</div>
<div class="w3-container">
	<p>
		Not to be confused with users, the ones typing the input, the <strong>player</strong> is the representation
		of the current viewpoint in the world. The purpose of the player is to define or constrain what is currently visible 
		in terms of actions or objects. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Players also can have a current <strong>room</strong>, which further controls what
		the player can both do and interact with. A TAME module is not required to have a player, but without players, you
		cannot set the current room. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Players can also hold <strong>objects</strong>. The objects held by a player are <em>accessible</em> so long
		as that player is current. Players also handle failed actions and other input errors before they are 
		passed onto the world. You can also restrict the actions that a player can use.
	</p>
</div>

<div id="rooms" class="w3-panel w3-light-gray w3-card-2">
	<h2><a href="#rooms"><i class="link-stub fa fa-link"></i></a> 2.3 Rooms <a class="w3-right" href="#top"><i class="link-stub fa fa-arrow-up"></i></a></h2>
</div>
<div class="w3-container">
	<p>
		<strong>Rooms</strong> are little abstractions of environment between which players are moved. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Rooms can contain <strong>objects</strong>. These objects are <em>accessible</em> as long as it is current on 
		the current <strong>player</strong>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Rooms can also restrict what actions can be used in them, much like players.
	</p>

<div id="containers" class="w3-panel w3-light-gray w3-card-2">
	<h2><a href="#containers"><i class="link-stub fa fa-link"></i></a> 2.4 Containers <a class="w3-right" href="#top"><i class="link-stub fa fa-arrow-up"></i></a></h2>
</div>
<div class="w3-container">
	<p>
		<strong>Containers</strong>, much like <strong>rooms</strong> and players, and the <strong>world</strong>,
		can contain <strong>objects</strong> and variable context. However, nothing in a container is
		<em>accessible</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Containers are useful for containing objects that need to be tagged or bulk-moved to other containers,
		or keeping track of other object-like things that could be useful, like objective lists or the like,
		since they can be browsed like any other thing that can contain objects.
	</p>

<div id="objects" class="w3-panel w3-light-gray w3-card-2">

<div class="w3-container">
	<p>
		Lastly, we have <strong>objects</strong>. These can be moved between all of the object containers 
		(<em>world</em>, <em>player</em>, <em>room</em>, <em>container</em>) and are the common element
		that are targeted by actions.
	</p>
	<p>
		Where <em>objects</em> are contained dictate their availability, as well as the current player
		or room. Available objects affect how user input is interpreted.

<div id="actions" class="w3-panel w3-light-gray w3-card-2">

	<p>
		The way that the user is able to make stuff happen is through <strong>Actions</strong>. Each
		action has a set of names, and there are different types of actions that influence how they get
		interpreted or how a command is expected to be completed.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are 5 action types: <strong>General</strong>, <strong>Modal</strong>, <strong>Open</strong>, <strong>Transitive</strong>, 
		and <strong>Ditransitive</strong>.
