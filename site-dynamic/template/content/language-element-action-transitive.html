				<td>[MODIFIERS]</td>
				<td>
					An optional declaration of one or more additional modifiers for action behavior.<br/>
					<br/>
					<kbd>restricted</kbd>: Denotes that this action is available only in situations that
					<em>explicitly</em> allow it to be used and interpreted. By default, actions are not 
					restricted.<br/>
					<kbd>strict</kbd>: Apply "strict behavior" to the handling of this action. "Strict"
					<em>transitive</em> actions do not tolerate additional things typed at the interpreter past a
					valid parsed object after the action.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>[IDENTIFIER]</td>
				<td>
					An internal <a href="tamescript.html#identifiers">identifier</a> that represents this
					action in the rest of TAMEScript. This is used to find what entry blocks throughout the
					code should be executed when a name associated with this action is parsed by the interpreter
					or when a specific action is queued by another command. This identifier must not be used to
					describe another element.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>[NAME_CLAUSE]</td>
				<td>
					The keyword <kbd>named</kbd> followed by a comma-delimited list of strings that the
					interpreter is supposed to associate with this command. The compiler does not check for
					name duplicates - equivalent names overwrite their association. Names, internally, are 
					sanitized to what the interpreter accepts.<br/>
					<br/>
					This clause is <em>optional</em> - if no names are declared, this is not parse-able in the
					interpreter. Leaving this out is a way to make "private" actions.
