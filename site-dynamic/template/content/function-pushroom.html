	<h3>What It Does</h3>
</div>
<div class="w3-container">
	<p>
		This function sets the topmost room in a specific player's room stack to the provided 
		room by "pushing" the provided room onto the top of it (thus making it "current" for that player). 
		From the moment that this function is executed, all functions and operations that use 
		the current room (provided that its associated player is also current) will use the one provided
		until another call to <strong>PushRoom()</strong> (or the other room-changing functions) changes it again.
	</p>
	<p>
		Since <strong>PushRoom()</strong> preserves the previously current room that the provided player was in, a call to 
		<a href="function-poproom.html">PopRoom()</a> will restore it for that player.
